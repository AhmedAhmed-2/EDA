    "1. Show that $m(a + bX) = a+b \\times m(X)$.\n",

    "5. The transformation $Z = bX$ is called an **linear** transformation, and in that case, $m(bX) = b\\times m(X)$ and $\\text{cov}(X,bY) = b \\times \\text{cov}(X,Y)$. If we used another kind of transformation of $Y$ -- say, $g(Y) = Y^2$ or $g(Y) = \\sqrt{Y}$ -- is it generally true that $m( g(X)) = g(m(X))$ and $ \\text{cov}(X,g(Y) ) = g( \\text{cov}(X,Y)) $? \n",

    "    - The mean of a transformed variable is not the transformation of the mean. \n",
    "    - Sample covariance is a useful concept, but can only capture information about linear relationships between variables, not non-linear ones.\n",
    "7. Instead of the mean, consider the median. Consider transformations that are non-decreasing (also called order-preserving), like $2+5 \\times X$ or $\\text{arcsinh}(X)$. Is a non-decreasing transformation of the median the median of the transformed variable? Explain. Does your answer apply to any quantile? The IQR? The range? "
